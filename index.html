    <h1>Hi! I'm Sunray</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>Who Am I?</p>
    <p>
        A student, anime nerd, and software developer. I am currently studying Information Technology at <a href="https://www.nyp.edu.sg/">Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP)</a>.
        I like to go by Sunray online, but my real name is Jake Onquit. Nice to meet you!
    </p>
    <p>What do I do?</p>
    <p>
        As I said, I am an amateur software developer, mainly in Python and Javascript. 
        I have a <span><a href="https://github.com/sunrayyourdev">GitHub!</a></span> You can also check out my digital portfolio for coding related inquiries.
        Other than that, I like to code, play games and watch anime of course! 
        The games I play most frequently are Cyberpunk 2077, Valorant and Rainbow Six Siege. I post highlights on my Youtube, check it out!
        My favourite game of all time is probably Minecraft though, the nostalgia man.
        As for anime, my top 3 are Assassination Classroom (obviously), Violet Evergarden, and K-on! 
        You can visit my Anime page or visit my MAL to see more of what I watch.
    </p>
    <p>What is this website for?</p>
    <p>A place to put all my favourite things, and share what I like! Also a tool for employers to get a better idea of my personality jkjk</p>
